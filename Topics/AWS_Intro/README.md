# 🌩️ Introduction to AWS

Welcome to the **Introduction to AWS** guide — your first step into the world of **cloud computing** using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.  
This document will help you understand what AWS is, its core concepts, and why it’s one of the most in-demand skills for tech professionals.

## 🧭 What is AWS?

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is a **cloud computing platform** provided by Amazon.  
It offers a wide range of services such as computing power, database storage, networking, and machine learning — all on demand, over the internet, and with a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model.

AWS enables individuals, startups, and enterprises to:
- Build and deploy applications quickly  
- Scale resources automatically  
- Pay only for what they use  
- Avoid the cost of maintaining physical servers

## ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the **delivery of IT resources** (like servers, storage, databases, etc.) over the internet instead of using on-premise infrastructure.

### 🔹 Example:
Traditionally, companies had to buy and maintain their own servers.  
With cloud computing, you can rent these servers virtually from AWS and scale them anytime as per your needs.

## 🧩 Types of Cloud Computing

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | Provides basic building blocks like servers, networking, and storage | Amazon EC2 |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) | Provides a platform for developers to build and deploy apps without managing infrastructure | AWS Elastic Beanstalk |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service) | Delivers fully managed software applications over the internet | Gmail, Salesforce |

## 🔰 AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS provides global services using a distributed architecture:

- **Regions:** Physical locations around the world (e.g., `us-east-1`, `ap-south-1`)
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Data centers within a region
- **Edge Locations:** Used by **CloudFront (CDN)** for low-latency delivery

🗺️ Example:  
`ap-south-1` = Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region  
This region may have 3 availability zones like `ap-south-1a`, `ap-south-1b`, `ap-south-1c`.
